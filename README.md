# Sky Mart Cloud Architecture

## Overview
This repository contains the cloud architecture design for **Sky Mart Express**, a logistics and retail company aiming to deliver a seamless and scalable framework for efficient operations. The architecture leverages Azure cloud services to optimize data ingestion, processing, and analytics.

## Objectives
1. Accelerate order processing for smooth and accurate transactions.
2. Enable real-time tracking of inventory, orders, and customer interactions.
3. Generate actionable market insights for strategic decision-making.
4. Optimize resource utilization, including staff, inventory, and infrastructure.
5. Deliver personalized customer experiences with targeted campaigns and recommendations.
6. Provide comprehensive reports for stakeholders to support informed decision-making.

## Architecture Highlights
### Key Components
- **Event Hub**: Ingests real-time streaming data such as geo-location, traffic, and website activity.
- **Azure Data Factory**: Automates batch data ingestion and transformation.
- **Azure Data Lake**: Serves as the centralized storage repository for raw and processed data.
- **Azure Databricks**: Enables advanced data analytics, machine learning, and predictive insights.
- **Azure Synapse Analytics**: Provides a data warehouse for refined, structured data.
- **Power BI**: Generates interactive dashboards for stakeholders to monitor key metrics.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Supports demand forecasting, route optimization, and anomaly detection.

### Layered Architecture
- **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data from both batch and streaming sources.
- **Silver Layer**: Cleansed and integrated data ready for analysis.
- **Gold Layer**: Refined, query-optimized data for reporting and visualization.

## Pipeline Details
- **Batch Ingestion**: Utilizes Azure Data Factory for scheduled data updates.
- **Streaming Ingestion**: Leverages Azure Event Hub for real-time data flow.
- **Data Processing**:
